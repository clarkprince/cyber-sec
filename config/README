# Configuration files for the development server

A lot of the functionalities of the server (e.g. grammars, OAuth, â€¦) are stored in configuration files.

We provide, by default, configuration that make sense for most of us.

If you need to override a configuration file, replace the suffix by `.local.toml`, e.g. `oauth.local.toml`.
Those files are ignored in the VCS, but take precedence when running the server locally
