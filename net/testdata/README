# Watchdog for networks

Network configuration can be a bit jumpy at times.
This tool tries (hard) to keep interfaces up and running, in the face of network conditions

Configuration is stored as an SQLite database, and provides the objects:

=> profile (set of configuration, )
=> ports (which one is up, down)
=> ips 

# Appel (user-level API)

On site: setting up a network with one DMZ, and two monitored zone.
The zones allow lateral movement

# Mode of operations

1. Ensure that ip interfaces are set up as expected (use iproute)
2. Use pings, and friends, building up trust that everything is set up
3. Check name resolution
4. Check status of DNSMasq

# List of profiles

Move to specifications??

=> adm: Admin zones

send a dhcp probe on the network (dhclient -1),
if it does not work, fall over to starting own DHCP server (makes connect easy)

=> dmz: De-militarized zone

start automatically via DHCP.
   if it does not work, fail, and require manual set up

Port 1, configures the 

=> mtr: Monitored zone



isc-dhcp installed by default
=> dhclient w/ config by default on enp1s0

=> set names of devices ??
